<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
So I'm about to make my new ICS smartfolio, portsmolio... techfolio.
Right, techfolio.
</p>

<p>
I'm already unsure of where to begin, but I haven't really started yet so not
sure why I'm already complaining.  Seems like something you pull, and then
push to your own repo? Will be back soon.
</p>
<p>
Found info on how to make the techfolio, initial assumption was correct.
You pull the techfolio project, then edit the files to your liking.
Once youre satisfied, you push to your own github.io site. Having the ability
to view changes locally would be good because sometimes we like to work
without an internet connection. Being able to view changes on the fly would be
great.

At this point, I've gotten tired of following the guide step by step, and
have moved on to editing the bio.js file which I found to be relatively
painless.  One thing I did notice is that updates to the files in the repo
take some time to appear on the site, which is slightly annoying.
</p>

<p>
I've been working for a while now, so I will come back to this hopefully
tomorrow.

<p>
At this point, tomorrow is yesterday. I've gotten my bio to a point where I'm
satisfied with it for now, and have moved on to adding these notes to an essay.
It doesn't seem so painful, but I can see how it might be inconvenient to
someone who isn't used to editing text files on a computer.
</p>
<p>
I have yet to explore techfolio's inner workings.  I am unsure as to why the
files within the various content directories have the .md extension, but I
changed them to .html and things are still working, plus my editor now formats
my files correctly. Yay!
