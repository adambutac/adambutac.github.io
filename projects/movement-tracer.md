summary: Using a camera and the java api OpenIMAJ I was able to extract movement across a flat surface at a set distance.  I then fed the movement data into a controller also programmed in java which then sends a pwm signal to servo motors via the audio auxillary output of a laptop.  The servos controlled the pan and tilt of a laser pointer.
